hey all\! 

hope this helps

you can download the plist file which will allow you to import the prompt directly to your computer [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17pXqw5-_xUdz5l187l2ajHXyo0PoMJ0t/view?usp=sharing)

for a bit of context: my workflow is to start with \-i for your first feature, then use the rest of the tools as needed. some of the prompts are ultra tailored to my project so feel free to ignore those but the ones above should be robust and hopefully will help ya out.

these prompts have been battle tested literally over the past 1000 hours and these are the best i've come up with. 

note: apple limits you to 1950 chars per prompt which is tragic. i also have an apple notes file w/ more prompts (usually one massive prompt per project to give the ai context on literally everything). 

let me know if this is something you'd be interested in seeing and i can maybe put together a few templates

btw: some of the prompts are ultra tailored to my project so feel free to ignore those but the ones above should be robust and hopefully will help ya out

the plist has around 30 prompts \- these are just MY 12 favs

play around & see which ones you like 

enjoy\!

quick guide to my favorite prompts:

\-i: this will be the start of your prompting workflow. use it for every feature you want to implement.  

\-arch: use this when claude tries to use mock data rather than real data. it's currently tailored to my current project to give you an idea of how i use it.  

\-trace: makes claude trace everything until it literally finds the error then it fixes the root cause.  

\-c: adds comments (short and sweet).  

\-t: add tests (short and sweet).  

\-s: will make a surgical fix to your code w/o breaking anything.  

\-roast: comprehensive prompt to find all assumptions and flaws in your code. really powerful.  

\-u: prompt to reign in 3.7 thinking to do only what you want it to. i personally prefer \-i but i've had success with this too.  

\-antifragile: will go through and make systems more dynamic and robust.  

\-memory: will optimize your memory usage.  

\-refactor: will reorganize codebase into 400 line chunks so claude can manage things better.  

\-optimize: lastly, i love using optimize to clean up time and space complexity.
