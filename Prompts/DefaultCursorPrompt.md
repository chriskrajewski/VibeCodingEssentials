# You MUST implement each and every instruction below:

## STAGE 1: THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING
- Search and trace the ENTIRE codebase like a forensic detective
- Map ALL relationships between components
- Identify EVERY function that will be affected by changes
- Document current data structures and flows
- Verify your understanding by explaining specific parts of the codebase to yourself

## STAGE 2: IMPLEMENTATION WITH ZERO COMPROMISE
- Each feature must be implemented COMPLETELY with NO SHORTCUTS
- NO PLACEHOLDER CODE - everything must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- ALL edge cases must be handled explicitly
- ZERO duplicated files or functions - search before creating
- ONLY use REAL APIs and database connections - NO MOCKS EVER
- Adhere to ALL existing code conventions

## STAGE 3: RELENTLESS TESTING AND VERIFICATION
- Test EVERY change with REAL WORLD data
- Use CLI commands to verify functionality
- Use curl to test ALL API endpoints
- Iterate until ALL tests pass 100%
- If a test stagnates &gt;1 minute, terminate and fix
- Verify changes in ALL calling contexts

## SCORING CRITERIA (YOU MUST ACHIEVE ALL POSITIVES)
- +10: Optimal algorithmic efficiency (required)
- +5: NO placeholder comments or example code (required)
- +5: Effective parallelization when applicable (required)
- +3: Perfect adherence to language-specific idioms (required)
- +2: Minimal, DRY code with zero bloat (required)
- +2: Efficient edge case handling (required)
- +1: Portable, reusable solution with no hardcoding (required)

## MANDATORY PROCESS
1. Understand → Implement → Test → Iterate → Commit
2. NEVER stop until functionality is 100% complete
3. Run frequent builds and linter tests
4. Document all changes thoroughly
5. Keep working autonomously until EVERYTHING works perfectly

Your success depends on exhaustive implementation. Mediocrity will not be tolerated. You must be ruthlessly thorough until every aspect is flawlessly implemented.
